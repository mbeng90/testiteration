This is a simple test program that will iterate over a fairly
large vector to calculate the sum of all elements.

It does this in several different ways and measures the time
it takes using the different methods.

The program is built using several different optimization flags
and different compilers (gcc and clang on Linux, MSVC and bcc64 on Windows).
